# Project TODO

Last updated: 2025-01-18

## ðŸš¨ ACTIVE PRIORITIES

### **No Active High-Priority Technical Debt Remaining** âœ…

All major architectural improvements have been completed. The codebase now has:
- Clean dataclass-based record system without metaclass conflicts
- Explicit protocol inheritance for enhanced IDE support
- 3-tier Infrastructure/Platform/Languages architecture
- Comprehensive test coverage (73.45%)

### **Potential Next Priorities** ðŸ”® **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

**Option A: Performance Optimization**
- Profile deck generation pipeline performance
- Optimize image/audio processing bottlenecks
- Implement caching strategies for expensive operations

**Option B: Language Expansion**
- Enhance Korean/Russian implementations to full feature parity

**Option C: Feature Development**
- Advanced card customization options
- Interactive learning modes
- Progress tracking and analytics

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS

**Working State**:
- âœ… Three languages implemented: German (full), Russian (minimal), Korean (minimal)
- âœ… All tests passing, MyPy strict mode clean
- âœ… Multi-language architecture foundation complete
- âœ… **DeckBuilder Observable API** - 5-phase pipeline with structured data access
- âœ… **Infrastructure/Platform/Languages Architecture** - Clean 3-tier package structure complete
- âœ… **Test Coverage**: 73.45% with comprehensive unit and integration test suite

**Recently Completed Major Work**:
- âœ… **Pydantic to Dataclass Migration** - Eliminated metaclass conflicts, improved performance
- âœ… **Protocol Inheritance Implementation** - Enhanced PyCharm type visibility across all domain models
