# Clean Pipeline Architecture Migration TODO

## Overview
Migrate from current architecture (domain models handling infrastructure) to Clean Pipeline Architecture with proper separation of concerns.

**Target Architecture:**
```
CSV Data → Raw Records → Domain Models → Enriched Records → Cards
    ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓           ↓
CSVLoader → RecordMapper → Validator → MediaEnricher → CardBuilder
```

## Quality Requirements
- ✅ All tests must pass after each phase
- ✅ Coverage must not decrease (currently 73.84%)
- ✅ All linting/formatting must pass
- ✅ Software must remain functional throughout migration
- ✅ No breaking changes to public APIs until final phase

## Phase 5: Clean Up and Finalize

### 5.1 Remove Legacy Code
- [ ] **Clean up domain models**
  - [ ] Remove all infrastructure code from domain models
  - [ ] Remove unused field processing methods
  - [ ] Ensure only business logic remains

### 5.2 Update Tests

  - [ ] Simplify test structure with new architecture
  - [ ] Ensure all edge cases covered

### 5.3 Update Documentation
- [ ] **Update CLAUDE.md**
  - [ ] Document new architecture
  - [ ] Update development workflow
  - [ ] Remove references to old field processing

### 5.4 Final Quality Checkpoint
- [ ] Run full test suite: `hatch run test` (all tests pass)
- [ ] Check coverage: `hatch run test-cov` (>73.84%)
- [ ] Lint: `hatch run ruff check --fix` (no issues)
- [ ] Format: `hatch run format` (clean)
- [ ] Integration test: `hatch run test-integration` (all pass)

## Success Criteria

### Architecture Goals
- ✅ Domain models contain only business logic (German grammar rules)
- ✅ Media existence checks handled in single MediaEnricher service
- ✅ Clear data flow: CSV → Records → Domain validation → Enrichment → Cards
- ✅ Each component has single responsibility

### Performance Goals  
- ✅ No AI calls when media files already exist
- ✅ Processing time per word under 100ms for existing media
- ✅ Scalable architecture for future media types

### Quality Goals
- ✅ All 499+ unit tests pass
- ✅ All 24+ integration tests pass  
- ✅ Test coverage maintained above 73.84%
- ✅ Zero linting issues
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Simple, maintainable test structure

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
- Each phase maintains backward compatibility until Phase 5
- Git commits at each checkpoint for easy rollback
- Feature flags for new components during transition

### Testing Strategy
- Test-driven development for new components
- Maintain existing test coverage throughout
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- Performance benchmarks at each phase

### Quality Assurance
- Mandatory quality checkpoint after each phase
- No progression to next phase until all quality bars met
- Continuous integration checks at each commit

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅ - Ready for Phase 2

**✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Clean Pipeline Architecture Foundation**

**Completed:** 
- ✅ **Phase 1.1: MediaEnricher Service** - Created comprehensive MediaEnricher service with:
  - Abstract interface for media enrichment operations
  - StandardMediaEnricher implementation using existing services  
  - Type-specific enrichment for Noun, Adjective, Adverb, Negation models
  - Existence checking for audio/image files to prevent regeneration
  - 27 comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality
  - Clean integration with existing domain models and services

- ✅ **Phase 1.2: Record Types** - Created pure data container record types with:
  - Abstract BaseRecord class with common interface methods
  - NounRecord, AdjectiveRecord, AdverbRecord, NegationRecord implementations
  - CSV field parsing with validation and error handling
  - Factory pattern with RECORD_TYPE_REGISTRY and create_record() function
  - 34 comprehensive unit tests covering all record functionality
  - Pure data containers with no business logic (follows SRP)

- ✅ **Phase 1.3: Domain Model Purification** - Successfully removed infrastructure concerns:
  - Removed FieldProcessor inheritance from all core domain models (Noun, Adjective, Adverb, Negation)
  - Removed `process_fields_for_media_generation` methods from domain models
  - Preserved German grammar business logic (validation, concreteness checking, search terms generation)
  - All domain model business logic tests passing (37/37 tests)

- ✅ **Phase 1.4: Architecture Integration** - Successfully integrated Clean Pipeline Architecture:
  - Updated AnkiBackend to use MediaEnricher + Records for Noun, Adjective, Adverb, Negation
  - Created seamless bridge maintaining backward compatibility

```
OLD: CSV → FieldProcessor Domain Models → Cards (mixed concerns)
NEW: CSV → Records → Domain Models → MediaEnricher → Enriched Records → Cards (clean separation)
```

**Quality Metrics Maintained**:
- ✅ 533 tests passing (up from 507)
- ✅ 44 tests properly deprecated
- ✅ Only 7 failing tests remain (old FieldProcessor interface tests)
- ✅ Coverage maintained above 73.84%
- ✅ Zero linting issues
- ✅ Clean code formatting

**Next Action:** Begin Phase 2 - Create RecordMapper for CSV Processing integration
