2. **Must improve test coverage** before backend migration (safety requirement)
3. **Must complete backend migration** before multi-language work (architecture dependency)
4. **Must establish multi-language foundation** before German expansion (avoid rework)

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Type Safety**: Incremental fixes with continuous validation
- **Coverage**: Focus on high-impact, untested areas first
- **Backend Migration**: Thorough testing before production switch
- **Multi-Language**: Design validation with second language prototype

### **Resource Requirements**
- **Weeks 1-3**: Code quality foundation (full focus)
- **Weeks 4-8**: Backend migration completion
- **Weeks 9-14**: Multi-language architecture
- **Weeks 15-24**: German language expansion

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 6 months with systematic quality-first approach
