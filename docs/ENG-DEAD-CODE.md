## 🎯 Dead Code Categorization

### **Category 1: True Dead Code (Immediate Removal Candidates)**

**Verdict: SAFE TO REMOVE**

```python
# These modules are never imported or used anywhere
src/langlearn/models/cardinal_number.py     # 50 statements
src/langlearn/models/ordinal_number.py      # 50 statements
src/langlearn/models/conjunction.py         # 61 statements
src/langlearn/models/interjection.py        # 26 statements
src/langlearn/models/personal_pronoun.py    # 41 statements
src/langlearn/models/other_pronoun.py       # 64 statements
src/langlearn/models/possessive_pronoun.py  # 64 statements

# Legacy verb models superseded by VerbConjugationRecord
src/langlearn/models/regular_verb.py        # 8 statements
src/langlearn/models/irregular_verb.py      # 40 statements  
src/langlearn/models/separable_verb.py      # 14 statements
```
