## Architecture Overview

The langlearn system follows a three-tier architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **üéØ Platform Layer** (`langlearn.core.*`): "You extend this" - Extension points and orchestration
- **üåç Languages Layer** (`langlearn.languages.*`): "You implement this" - Language-specific implementations

2. **Create Record Classes**: Extend platform `BaseRecord` for data validation
3. **Build Language Services**: Implement `CardProcessorProtocol` and `TTSConfig`
4. **Register with Platform**: Add to language discovery system

### Adding New Infrastructure Services

1. **Define Clear Interface**: Create protocol or abstract base class
2. **Implement Service**: Add to `infrastructure/services/`
3. **Update ServiceContainer**: Add dependency injection support
4. **Integrate with Platform**: Connect to orchestration layer

### Adding New Platform Features

1. **Design Extension Points**: Create protocols for language implementation
2. **Build Orchestration Logic**: Add to platform layer
3. **Update Documentation**: Document new extension capabilities
4. **Provide Examples**: Show usage in existing language implementations

The Infrastructure/Platform/Languages architecture enables clean separation of concerns while providing powerful extension capabilities for new languages and features.
