## üéØ Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive design guidance for the language learning application, establishing architectural principles, coding standards, and strategic direction. The application's **primary goal is multi-language support** for creating vocabulary learning materials, with German as the initial implementation.

**Critical Design Philosophy**: Use external validated data for grammatical forms - never algorithmic grammar processing, as languages lack sufficient standardization for logical rule-based approaches.

## üìä Current State Assessment (Critical Analysis)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Identified Quality Gaps** 

Our analysis reveals significant gaps between documented principles and actual implementation:

#### **Immediate Issues Requiring Attention**:
1. **Type Safety Failure**: 363 MyPy strict mode errors indicate systematic type safety violations
2. **Import Structure Violations**: 113+ linting errors, including 26+ relative import violations  
3. **Test Coverage Gap**: Current coverage 56.27%, target >85% for production readiness
4. **SRP Documentation Gap**: Claims of "EXCELLENT" SRP adherence don't match code reality
5. **Domain Logic Scattered**: DDD implementation is incomplete despite documentation claiming Phase 1 completion
6. **Multi-Language Readiness**: 2/10 - Hard-coded German logic prevents language expansion

#### **Architectural Assessment**:
- **Current Quality Score**: 6/10 (Good intentions, poor execution)
- **Technical Debt Level**: HIGH
- **Multi-Language Readiness**: POOR (requires major refactoring)
- **Maintainability**: MODERATE (structure helps, coupling hurts)

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Principles (MANDATORY)

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Rule**: Each class, module, and package must have ONE clear reason to change.

#### **‚úÖ Good Examples**:
```python
class AudioService:
    """Single responsibility: AWS Polly text-to-speech integration"""
    def generate_audio(self, text: str, language_code: str) -> str:
        # Only handles audio generation, nothing else
        pass

class CSVService:
    """Single responsibility: CSV data loading with type conversion"""
    def read_csv[T](self, file_path: str, model_class: type[T]) -> list[T]:
        # Only handles CSV reading and model conversion
        pass
```

#### **‚ùå Bad Examples (Fix Required)**:
```python
class AnkiBackend:
    """VIOLATES SRP - handles backend operations AND media generation AND domain logic"""
    def __init__(self, media_service: MediaService, german_service: GermanLanguageService):
        # Backend should not depend on domain services
        pass
    
    def _is_concrete_noun(self, noun: str) -> bool:
        # Domain logic in infrastructure layer violates SRP
        pass
```

#### **SRP Compliance Checklist**:
- [ ] Class has single, clear responsibility stated in docstring
- [ ] Class imports indicate focused purpose (< 5 external dependencies)
- [ ] Methods all relate to the single responsibility
- [ ] Changes to requirements affect only one responsibility per class

### 2. **Dependency Direction (Clean Architecture)**

**Rule**: Dependencies must flow inward. Infrastructure depends on Domain, not vice versa.

```
External APIs ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Domain Models ‚Üê Infrastructure ‚Üê Application
```

#### **‚úÖ Correct Dependency Flow**:
```python
# Domain Model (innermost layer) - no external dependencies
class Noun(BaseModel):
    def get_combined_audio_text(self) -> str:
        # Pure domain logic, no service dependencies
        pass

# Service Layer - depends on domain abstractions
class MediaService:
    def generate_audio_for_word(self, word: DomainModel) -> str:
        audio_text = word.get_combined_audio_text()  # Uses domain method
        return self._audio_service.generate(audio_text)
```

#### **‚ùå Wrong Dependency Flow (Fix Required)**:
```python
# Domain model depending on services (WRONG)
class Noun(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self, audio_service: AudioService):  # Domain ‚Üí Service dependency
        self._audio_service = audio_service  # VIOLATES clean architecture
```

### 3. **Multi-Language Architecture (CRITICAL)**

**Requirement**: All language-specific logic must be externalized and configurable.

#### **‚úÖ Language-Agnostic Design**:
```python
# Abstract language service
class LanguageService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def is_concrete_noun(self, noun: str) -> bool:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_abstract_suffixes(self) -> list[str]:
        pass

# Language-specific implementation
class GermanLanguageService(LanguageService):
    def __init__(self, config: LanguageConfig):
        self._config = config  # External configuration
        
    def is_concrete_noun(self, noun: str) -> bool:
        # Use external data, not hard-coded logic
        return noun.lower() not in self._config.abstract_words
```

#### **‚ùå Hard-coded Language Logic (PROHIBITED)**:
```python
# Hard-coded German logic (WRONG - prevents multi-language support)
class Noun:
    def is_concrete(self) -> bool:
        abstract_suffixes = ["heit", "keit", "ung"]  # German-specific hardcoding
        abstract_words = {"freiheit", "liebe"}       # German-specific hardcoding
        # This prevents the system from supporting other languages
```

**Multi-Language Compliance Requirements**:
- [ ] No hard-coded language-specific strings in code
- [ ] All grammar rules loaded from external data sources
- [ ] Language services implement common interface
- [ ] File paths and naming include language identifiers

## üì¶ Package Architecture Standards

### **Package Responsibility Matrix**

| **Package** | **Responsibility** | **Dependencies Allowed** | **Prohibited** |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **`models/`** | Domain entities and business rules | Standard library, Pydantic | External APIs, Services |
| **`services/`** | Business logic and API integration | Models, external libraries | Other services, backends |
| **`backends/`** | Data persistence and external systems | Models, standard library | Services, domain logic |
| **`managers/`** | Orchestration and workflow | Services, backends via interfaces | Direct external APIs |
| **`cards/`** | Presentation layer | Models, templates | Services, backends |
| **`utils/`** | Cross-cutting concerns | Standard library only | Domain logic, business rules |

### **Import Standards (MANDATORY)**

#### **‚úÖ Correct Import Patterns**:
```python
# Absolute imports for all internal modules (REQUIRED)
from langlearn.models.noun import Noun
from langlearn.services.audio import AudioService

# External dependencies clearly identified
import boto3
from pydantic import BaseModel
```

#### **‚ùå Prohibited Import Patterns**:
```python
# Relative imports (PROHIBITED - creates brittleness)
from ..models.noun import Noun
from ...services.audio import AudioService

# Circular imports (PROHIBITED)
# services importing from managers, managers importing from services
```

**Import Compliance Requirements**:
- [ ] All internal imports are absolute
- [ ] No circular dependencies between packages
- [ ] External dependencies documented in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Type hints use proper imports (avoid string literals)

## üß™ Testing Standards

### **Test Coverage Requirements**

| **Component Type** | **Minimum Coverage** | **Required Test Types** | **Focus Areas** |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Domain Models** | 95% | Unit tests, property-based tests | Business logic, validation, edge cases |
| **Services** | 90% | Unit tests, integration tests | API integration, error handling |
| **Backends** | 85% | Unit tests, contract tests | Interface compliance, data transformation |
| **Managers** | 80% | Integration tests | Orchestration, workflow validation |

### **Test Quality Standards**

#### **‚úÖ High-Quality Tests**:
```python
class TestNounDomainBehavior:
    """Test domain behavior, not just data validation"""
    
    def test_concrete_noun_classification_with_german_rules(self) -> None:
        """Test German-specific logic with external data"""
        config = load_test_language_config("german")
        service = GermanLanguageService(config)
        
        # Test with known concrete nouns from external data
        assert service.is_concrete_noun("Katze") is True
        assert service.is_concrete_noun("Freiheit") is False
        
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("word,expected", [
        ("Sch√∂nheit", False),  # -heit suffix
        ("K√§tzchen", True),    # -chen diminutive
    ])
    def test_suffix_based_classification(self, word: str, expected: bool) -> None:
        """Test classification rules systematically"""
        # Test implementation
```

#### **‚ùå Poor Test Examples**:
```python
def test_noun():
    """Bad: unclear purpose, no specific behavior tested"""
    noun = Noun(noun="test", article="die", ...)
    assert noun.noun == "test"  # Only tests data storage, not business logic
```

### **Test Architecture Requirements**

- [ ] **Isolated**: Tests don't depend on external services in unit tests
- [ ] **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- [ ] **Fast**: Unit tests complete in <100ms each
- [ ] **Comprehensive**: Edge cases and error conditions covered
- [ ] **Maintainable**: Test refactoring follows production code changes

## üéØ Strategic Direction & Long-term Goals

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Current - 6 months)**
**Goal**: Establish robust single-language (German) implementation with clean architecture

**Priorities**:
1. **Fix Type Safety**: Resolve all MyPy errors
2. **Implement True SRP**: Eliminate domain logic from services and backends  
3. **External Data Integration**: Move all German grammar rules to configuration files
4. **Test Coverage**: Achieve minimum coverage standards

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Zero MyPy strict mode errors
- [ ] Zero architectural linting violations
- [ ] All domain logic centralized in models or external data
- [ ] 85%+ test coverage for production components (currently 56.27%)
- [ ] Coverage must increase with each code change (use `hatch run test-unit-cov`)

### **Phase 2: Multi-Language Foundation (6-12 months)**
**Goal**: Architecture supports multiple languages without code changes

**Key Changes**:
1. **Language Service Abstraction**: `LanguageService` interface with pluggable implementations
2. **External Grammar Data**: All language rules in JSON/YAML configuration files
3. **Language-Agnostic Models**: Domain models work with any language configuration
4. **Internationalization Infrastructure**: Language-specific templates and resources

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Second language (e.g., Spanish) implementable in <1 week
- [ ] No language-specific code in core logic
- [ ] Language switching at runtime
- [ ] Automated validation of language configurations

### **Phase 3: Advanced NLP Integration (12-18 months)**
**Goal**: Leverage Stanza or similar NLP libraries for enhanced capabilities

**Capabilities**:
1. **Automatic Grammar Analysis**: Part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing
2. **Phrase-Level Learning**: Move beyond atomic word flashcards to contextual phrases
3. **Semantic Relationships**: Related word discovery and contextual groupings
4. **Content Validation**: Automated verification of grammar rule consistency

**NLP Integration Principles**:
- **External Data Priority**: NLP supplements, never replaces, validated grammar data
- **Language-Specific Models**: Each language uses appropriate NLP models
- **Graceful Degradation**: System functions without NLP when unavailable
- **Performance Considerations**: NLP processing is asynchronous and cached

### **Phase 4: Advanced Learning Features (18+ months)**
**Goal**: Sophisticated learning content generation

**Features**:
1. **Contextual Phrase Generation**: Automatic phrase creation from vocabulary
2. **Difficulty Progression**: Adaptive content complexity
3. **Cultural Context Integration**: Region-specific usage and cultural notes
4. **Interactive Grammar Exercises**: Beyond flashcards to active practice

## üõ°Ô∏è Code Quality Gates

### **Pre-Commit Requirements (ENFORCED)**
```bash
# All code must pass these checks before commit
hatch run ruff check --fix       # Linting with auto-fix
hatch run format                 # Code formatting
hatch run type                   # Type checking (MyPy strict)  
hatch run test-unit             # Unit test execution
```

**Failure Policy**: Code that fails any check cannot be committed.

### **Code Review Checklist**

#### **Architecture Review** (All Changes):
- [ ] Follows SRP - single clear responsibility
- [ ] Correct dependency direction (Clean Architecture)
- [ ] No hard-coded language-specific logic
- [ ] Proper abstraction level for the change

#### **Implementation Review**:
- [ ] Type hints on all public interfaces
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] No bare `except` clauses
- [ ] Proper logging at appropriate levels

#### **Testing Review**:
- [ ] New tests for all new functionality  
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions covered
- [ ] No tests testing implementation details
- [ ] Mock external dependencies properly

## üöß Anti-Patterns (PROHIBITED)

### **1. Algorithmic Grammar Processing**
```python
# WRONG - Never use algorithmic grammar rules
def get_plural(noun: str) -> str:
    if noun.endswith("s"):
        return noun + "es"  # Algorithmic approach fails for languages
    return noun + "s"

# CORRECT - Always use external validated data
def get_plural(noun: str, language_data: LanguageConfig) -> str:
    return language_data.plurals.get(noun, f"{noun}s")  # External data source
```

### **2. Cross-Layer Dependencies**
```python
# WRONG - Domain depending on infrastructure  
class Noun(BaseModel):
    def save_to_database(self):  # Domain model with persistence logic
        pass

# CORRECT - Separation of concerns
class NounRepository:  # Infrastructure layer
    def save(self, noun: Noun) -> None:
        pass
```

### **3. Hard-coded Language Logic**
```python
# WRONG - German logic embedded in code
GERMAN_ARTICLES = ["der", "die", "das"]  # Hard-coded German

# CORRECT - Configurable language data
class LanguageConfig:
    articles: list[str]  # Loaded from external configuration
```

### **4. God Classes and Services**
```python
# WRONG - Single class doing everything
class GermanProcessor:
    def generate_audio(self): pass
    def find_images(self): pass  
    def validate_grammar(self): pass
    def create_cards(self): pass  # Too many responsibilities

# CORRECT - Single responsibility services
class AudioService: ...
class ImageService: ...
class GrammarValidator: ...
class CardGenerator: ...
```
