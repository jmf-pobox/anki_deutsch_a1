# Documentation Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Purpose**: Documentation consolidation and DRY principle implementation

## Changes Made

### New Documents Created

#### 1. ENG-SYSTEM-DESIGN.md
**Purpose**: Explain the complete CSV → Anki card pipeline with SRP principles  
**Key Content**:
- Step-by-step pipeline explanation (CSV → RecordMapper → Records → MediaEnricher → CardBuilder → AnkiBackend)
- Single Responsibility Principle implementation for each component
- Complete guide for adding new card types
- Performance optimizations and error handling

#### 2. ENG-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all development activities  
**Key Content**:
- Consolidated development workflow and quality gates
- Merged content from ENG-DEVELOPMENT-STANDARDS.md, ENG-BRANCH-WORKFLOW.md, and ENG-PYTHON-STANDARDS.md
- Complete testing standards and patterns
- API key management and troubleshooting
- Common tasks and best practices

### Documents Updated

#### 1. ENG-ARCHITECTURE.md
**Changes**: Refocused on high-level system architecture  
**Removed**: 
- Outdated metrics and TODO items
- Duplicate development workflow information
- German-specific implementation details

**Added**:
- Clear system layers explanation
- Architectural patterns (Clean Pipeline, DI, Strategy)
- Technology stack overview
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### 2. ENG-DESIGN-INDEX.md
**Changes**: Simplified navigation and removed redundancy  
**Updated**:
- Essential reading order (Development Guide → System Design → Architecture)
- Clear document purposes
- Legacy documentation section
- How to generate current metrics

#### 3. CLAUDE.md
**Changes**: Updated to reference new documentation structure  
**Key Updates**:
- Required reading now points to 3 core documents
- Current metrics reflect actual test counts (813 tests)
- Simplified quality maintenance section
- References to detailed guides instead of inline duplication

## Documents Marked as Legacy

The following documents are maintained for reference but should not be primary sources:
- **ENG-QUALITY-METRICS.md** - Contains historical metrics; use `hatch run test-cov` for current data
- **ENG-DEVELOPMENT-STANDARDS.md** - Content integrated into ENG-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md
- **ENG-BRANCH-WORKFLOW.md** - Content integrated into ENG-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md
- **ENG-TYPE-SAFETY.md** - Reference only; type safety is now standard practice
- **ENG-PYTHON-STANDARDS.md** - General standards; project-specific in ENG-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md

## DRY Principle Implementation

### Information Now Lives in One Place
- **Development workflow**: ENG-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md only
- **System design**: ENG-SYSTEM-DESIGN.md only
- **Architecture overview**: ENG-ARCHITECTURE.md only
- **Current metrics**: Generated live via commands (not stored)

### How to Get Current Metrics
```bash
# Test coverage
hatch run test-cov

# Type checking status  
hatch run type

# Linting status
hatch run ruff check

# Test count
hatch run test --co -q | grep "test" | wc -l
```

## Quality Standards (Unchanging)

### Mandatory Quality Gates
1. **MyPy**: 0 errors in strict mode
2. **Ruff**: 0 violations
3. **Tests**: All must pass
4. **Coverage**: Must not decrease from current level

### Development Requirements
- All changes via feature branches
- Quality gates must pass before commit
- One change per commit (SRP for commits)
- Clear commit messages with impact noted

## Benefits of This Update

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: Information exists in exactly one place
2. **Clear Navigation**: Developers know exactly where to find information
3. **Current Information**: Metrics are generated live, not stored as snapshots
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to keep documentation current
5. **Learning Path**: Clear progression from development guide to system design to architecture

## Next Steps for Developers

1. Read **ENG-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md** for all development activities
2. Understand the pipeline via **ENG-SYSTEM-DESIGN.md**
3. Review architecture in **ENG-ARCHITECTURE.md** for design patterns
4. Use **ENG-COMPONENT-INVENTORY.md** to find specific components
5. Generate current metrics using the provided commands
