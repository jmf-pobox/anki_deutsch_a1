# Anki Library Migration Plan: genanki → Official Anki Library

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS

**Last Updated**: August 2025  
**Project State**: ✅ Functional German A1 deck generator with backend abstraction layer  
**Migration Status**: 🔄 Architecture prepared, testing in progress

---

## Executive Summary

This project has implemented a backend abstraction layer supporting both genanki and official Anki library backends. The current implementation uses genanki as the active backend while maintaining the capability to switch to the official Anki library.

## Current State Analysis

### Actual Installed Dependencies
```bash
# From hatch run pip list (August 2025)
genanki==0.13.1          # ✅ ACTIVE - Currently used by main.py
anki==25.7.5              # ✅ AVAILABLE - Installed but not primary backend
```

### Current Usage Patterns  
**Active Implementation:**
- **Primary usage**: `src/langlearn/main.py` → `GermanDeckBuilder` with `backend_type="genanki"`
- **Backend file**: `src/langlearn/backends/genanki_backend.py` (actively used)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional deck generation

**Available but Secondary:**
- **Official library**: `src/langlearn/backends/anki_backend.py` (implemented but not primary)
- **Migration capability**: Could switch by changing `backend_type="anki"` in main.py
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed

### Test Status
- **Current Tests**: 263 tests passing (not the 238/238 claimed in original document)
- **Backend Coverage**: Both backends have test coverage through abstraction layer
- **Quality**: Tests demonstrate backend switching capability

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Backend abstraction layer implemented

#### Achievements:
- ✅ Both libraries installed and importable
- ✅ Backend abstraction layer in `src/langlearn/backends/`
- ✅ Working implementations for both genanki and official Anki backends
- ✅ Demonstration script showing backend switching capability
- ✅ Test suite covering both backends

### Phase 2: Full Implementation 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Complete feature parity and comprehensive testing

#### Current Status:
- ✅ Core deck generation working with both backends
- ✅ Media integration functional
- ⚠️ Advanced features need validation
- ⚠️ Production readiness testing required

#### Remaining Tasks:
1. **Comprehensive Feature Testing**
   - Validate all German language features work with official backend
   - Test media generation pipeline thoroughly
   - Performance testing and optimization

2. **Production Readiness Validation**
   - End-to-end testing with full vocabulary dataset
   - Error handling validation
   - Memory and performance profiling

### Phase 3: Migration Decision 📋 PLANNED
**Goal**: Choose production backend based on testing results

#### Current Recommendation: Continue with genanki
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ Stable, well-tested implementation
- ✅ Proven to work with current feature set
- ✅ Lower risk for production use
- ⚠️ Official backend needs more validation

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: MEDIUM
- **Architecture**: ✅ Sound foundation with backend abstraction
- **Stability**: ✅ genanki backend proven stable
- **Migration Path**: ✅ Clear path available
- **Testing**: ⚠️ Official backend needs more comprehensive testing

### Risk Mitigation:
1. **Gradual Migration**: Keep both backends available
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate official backend thoroughly before primary use
3. **Fallback Capability**: Maintain ability to revert to genanki
4. **Quality Gates**: Establish clear success criteria for migration

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Status | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------|------------------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | 1-2 weeks | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Backend abstraction, both implementations |
| Phase 2: Validation | 2-3 weeks | 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** | Feature parity validation, comprehensive testing |
| Phase 3: Decision | 1 week | 📋 **PLANNED** | Production backend selection |

## Success Metrics

### Current Achievements ✅
- Backend abstraction layer functional
- Both libraries working through common interface
- Test coverage established (263 tests passing)
- Demonstration of backend switching capability

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- ✅ All German language features work with official backend
- ✅ Media generation produces identical results
- ✅ Performance meets or exceeds genanki backend
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive and tested

## Conclusion

The migration architecture is sound with a working backend abstraction layer. The project can successfully generate German A1 vocabulary decks using genanki while maintaining the capability to switch to the official Anki library. Further validation testing is needed before recommending the official backend for production use.

**Current Status**: Functional system with migration capability available when needed.
