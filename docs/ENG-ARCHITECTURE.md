### Key Architectural Features

#### 1. AI-Enhanced Image Search
- **Context Analysis**: Uses full German sentences, not just isolated words
- **Claude Integration**: Generates Pexels search queries based on usage context  
- **Learning Quality**: Images match actual usage scenarios for better retention
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to concept mappings if AI unavailable

#### 2. German Language Specialization
- **Grammar Validation**: Proper German declension and conjugation rules
- **Cultural Context**: German-specific usage examples and references
- **A1 Focus**: Complete coverage of beginner vocabulary (254 entries)
- **Audio Integration**: Native German pronunciation for all vocabulary

#### 3. Production Architecture
- **Official Anki Backend**: Native .apkg generation with proper media handling
- **Type Safety**: Complete MyPy strict compliance prevents runtime errors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with logging
- **Clean Interfaces**: Abstract base classes enable easy testing and extension

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Vocabulary Processing Flow
```
CSV Data → Domain Models → Field Processing → Media Enhancement → Anki Cards
```

**Details**:
- CSV service loads and validates vocabulary data
- Domain models apply German grammar rules and validation
- Field processors enhance with audio/images via AI services
- Anki backend generates final .apkg deck files

### 2. AI-Enhanced Image Flow
```
German Sentence → Claude Analysis → Context Query → Pexels Search → Local Storage
```

**Example**:
- Input: `"Das Essen schmeckt gut"` (The food tastes good)
- Claude: Analyzes sentence context about food/eating
- Query: `"delicious food plate smiling"`
- Result: Relevant food image instead of generic "good" concept

### 3. Audio Generation Flow  
```
German Text → AWS Polly → SSML Processing → MP3 Storage → Anki Integration
```

**Features**:
- German voice (Daniel) with proper pronunciation
- Sentence-level audio for context learning
- Caching to avoid duplicate API calls
- Automatic integration with Anki card fields

## Quality Architecture

### Code Quality Standards
- **MyPy Strict**: 0 type errors maintained across codebase
- **Ruff Compliance**: Clean code formatting and linting
- **Test Coverage**: 22.93% with comprehensive integration testing
- **Domain Testing**: Critical business logic fully covered

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Required quality gates:
hatch run test           # All tests pass
hatch run test-cov       # Coverage maintained
hatch run ruff check     # Clean code standards  
hatch run format         # Consistent formatting
hatch run type          # Type safety validation
```

### Architecture Validation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected into domain models
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean abstractions for different backends
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modifying existing code

## German Language Architecture

### Domain Model Design

#### Noun Model Features
```python
class Noun:
    article: str        # der/die/das with validation
    gender: str         # masculine/feminine/neuter
    plural: str         # German plural form with patterns
    declension: dict    # All four cases handled
```

#### Adjective Model Features
```python  
class Adjective:
    comparative: str    # German comparative form
    superlative: str    # German superlative form
    declension: bool    # Whether adjective declines
```

#### AI Integration Points
- **Context Queries**: Each model calls AnthropicService for image search
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation to hardcoded concept mappings
- **Error Resilience**: Models continue working if AI services fail

### Grammar Validation System
- **Article Agreement**: Validates der/die/das with noun genders
- **Case Handling**: Proper declension for all four German cases
- **Plural Patterns**: Validates German plural formation rules
- **Verb Conjugation**: Handles regular and irregular patterns

## Extension Architecture

### Multi-Language Readiness: 3/10
**Current Limitations**:
- German grammar rules hardcoded in domain models
- Template system specific to German sentence structure
- Language service not abstracted for reuse

**Planned Improvements**:
- Abstract LanguageService interface
- Configuration-driven grammar rules
- Language-agnostic template system
- External vocabulary configuration files

### Extensibility Points
1. **New Parts of Speech**: Follow domain model pattern
2. **Additional Backends**: Implement DeckBackend interface
3. **Enhanced AI**: Extend AnthropicService capabilities  
4. **Language Support**: Create language-specific configurations

## Performance Architecture

### Optimization Strategies
- **Media Caching**: Avoid duplicate image/audio downloads
- **Lazy Loading**: Load vocabulary data only when needed
- **Efficient Storage**: Organized file system structure
- **API Management**: Rate limiting and error handling for external services

### Scalability Considerations
- **Stateless Services**: Easy horizontal scaling
- **Clean Interfaces**: Swap implementations without code changes
- **Configuration Driven**: Behavior modification without compilation
- **Modular Design**: Independent component development and testing
