## Integration Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Core Learning Components)
1. **personal_pronouns.csv** - Essential for basic German
2. **cardinal_numbers.csv** - Fundamental vocabulary
3. **conjunctions.csv** - Needed for sentence construction

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Learning)
4. **ordinal_numbers.csv** - Dates and ordering
5. **other_pronouns.csv** - Possessives and demonstratives

### Low Priority (Advanced Features)
6. **interjections.csv** - Conversational fluency

## Migration Tasks

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Verify all verb data is in verbs_unified.csv
2. ‚¨ú Create Record classes for unintegrated CSV files
3. ‚¨ú Update RecordMapper to handle new record types
4. ‚¨ú Add new CSV files to deck_builder.py mapping

### Cleanup Actions
1. ‚úÖ Remove backup files after verification - **COMPLETED 2025-08-22**
2. ‚úÖ Archive legacy verb CSV files - **COMPLETED 2025-08-22**
3. ‚¨ú Consolidate pronoun CSV files if appropriate

## Data Quality Status

### Verified Clean
- ‚úÖ nouns.csv - Validated, english column correct
- ‚úÖ adjectives.csv - Validated, english column correct
- ‚úÖ verbs_unified.csv - Validated, english column correct
- ‚úÖ adverbs.csv - Validated structure
- ‚úÖ negations.csv - Validated structure

### Needs Review  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pronoun files - May have overlapping data

## File Size Summary

| Category | Files | Total Rows (est.) | Status |
|----------|-------|------------------|--------|
| Active Integrated | 7 | ~900 | ‚úÖ Production ready |
| Unintegrated | 6 | ~200 | üîß Awaiting integration |
| ~~Legacy~~ | ~~4~~ | ~~270~~ | ‚úÖ **REMOVED 2025-08-22** |
| ~~Backups~~ | ~~8~~ | ~~N/A~~ | ‚úÖ **REMOVED 2025-08-22** |

**Updated Summary**: 13 total CSV files remain (7 active + 6 unintegrated), with 12 obsolete files successfully removed.

## System Configuration

Current deck_builder.py CSV mapping:
```python
csv_files = {
    "nouns.csv": "noun",
    "adjectives.csv": "adjective", 
    "adverbs.csv": "adverb",
    "negations.csv": "negation",
    "prepositions.csv": "preposition",
    "phrases.csv": "phrase",
    "verbs_unified.csv": "verb_conjugation",
    # Legacy disabled:
    "verbs.csv": "verb",
    # "regular_verbs.csv": "verb",  # REMOVED
    # "irregular_verbs.csv": "verb",  # REMOVED
    # "separable_verbs.csv": "verb",  # REMOVED
}
```

## Recommendations

### For New Development
1. Use only ACTIVE CSV files
2. Follow PROD-CSV-SPEC.md for any modifications
3. Add new word types to verbs_unified.csv pattern
4. Maintain english column naming convention

### For Maintenance
1. Schedule removal of backup files
2. Archive legacy verb CSVs to separate directory
3. Implement integration for high-priority unintegrated files
4. Consider consolidating pronoun files

### For Quality Assurance
1. Run validation against PROD-CSV-SPEC.md
2. Check for duplicate entries across legacy/active files
3. Verify all example sentences are complete
4. Ensure UTF-8 encoding for special characters

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review and approve this inventory
2. **This Week**: Integrate personal_pronouns.csv and cardinal_numbers.csv
3. **This Month**: Complete integration of all unintegrated files
4. **Next Month**: Archive legacy files and remove backups
