"""Legacy card generation functionality (deprecated).

This module previously contained legacy card generators that have been
replaced by the Clean Pipeline Architecture using CardBuilder service.
All functionality has been migrated to:
- src/langlearn/services/card_builder.py
- src/langlearn/models/records.py

This module is kept as a placeholder to prevent import errors during
the migration period. It may be removed in a future version.
